# ebpf-proxy

An independently buildable native TCP relay and cgroup eBPF redirect component.
This directory is its own Go module. It has no dependency on its parent project,
WebUI, package manager, module layout, or any specific proxy product.
The upstream adapter currently implements SOCKS5 CONNECT (IPv4, IPv6, domain,
optional username/password). The relay treats bytes as opaque TCP streams.

## Phase 1

Build: Go 1.26.4, `make` or `go build ./cmd/ebpf-proxy`.
Android arm64: `make android` (CGO disabled).
Run a fixed-destination PoC, without kernel hooks:

```sh
ebpf-proxy probe-upstream --config config.json
ebpf-proxy poc --config config.json --destination 93.184.215.14:443
```

Configure a local listener and generic SOCKS5 endpoint using
`config.example.json`. Keep credential-bearing files private (mode 0600).
The daemon has bounded concurrent connections, bounded copy buffers, per
direction idle timeouts, EOF half-close, and cancellation cleanup.
No payload is logged or parsed. IPv6 is supported by the SOCKS5 adapter; BPF
redirect and transparent original-destination recovery are subsequent phases.

No kernel versions are yet claimed as fully supported. Android cgroup BPF
loading requires syscall and SELinux checks even with root. UDP policy is pass.
Kernel data structures will use stable UAPI contexts and a versioned shared ABI.
Native cgroup links will be required for crash detach; legacy persistent attach
will not be used. No CO-RE kernel field access is planned for kernels without BTF.

Testing: `go test ./internal/...` (and race testing on supported hosts).
Yakit MITM can be an example SOCKS5 upstream, but the component has no special
behavior for it. The user's trusted CA and upstream MITM behavior remain outside
this component. HTTP/2 and WebSocket bytes pass unchanged.

Extraction: copy this directory to a new repository and run the same builds;
there are no parent-relative source dependencies. BPF loader, CLI policy updates,
SELinux evidence and production lifecycle are tracked as subsequent phases.
